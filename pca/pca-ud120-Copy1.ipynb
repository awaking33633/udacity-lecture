    "PCA is used thoroughly for most of the time in visualization data, alongside feature set compression. It's hard (othwerwise impossible) to interpret the data with more than three dimension. So we reduce it to two/third dimension, allow us to make the visualization. This could come very handy if we want to capture the general information about the data, or to present it as business context. But it's not the tool that we use for combining two features, or compress it, as PCA throws some (important) information.\n",
